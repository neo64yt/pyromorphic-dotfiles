# waypipe --server requires a proper XDG_RUNTIME_DIR directory for the root user.
#
# That should typically be /run/user/0 or /var/run/0
#
# Unfortunalely, sudo does not create a user session so this variable is not set.
# Even worse, systemd destroys the directory when the last session terminates.
#
# In practice, that means that we cannot assume that /run/user/0 or /var/run/0
# exists and, even if it does exist, it cannot be safely used because it may
# be removed by systemd at any time. 
#
# Ideally, a user session should be created for user 0 (via systemctl?) 
# but this is not that easy. The alternative is to use a custom directory in /root
#
# The disadvantage is that the application may not be able to access services
# such as dbus.
